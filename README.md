## 🖋️ Handwritten Digit Detection Project
This project uses the **MNIST handwritten digit dataset** to train and test machine learning models that can recognize digits (0–9).

### Steps Involved:
1. **Data Preprocessing** – scaling and splitting dataset
2. **Model Training** – applying algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks
3. **Evaluation** – measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
4. **Prediction** – testing the model on new handwritten digits

   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the Project folder to explore the handwritten digit detection.
