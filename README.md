## 🖋️ Handwritten Digit Detection Project
This project uses the **MNIST handwritten digit dataset** to train and test machine learning models that can recognize digits (0–9).  

### Steps Involved:
1. **Data Preprocessing** – scaling and splitting dataset  
2. **Model Training** – applying algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks  
3. **Evaluation** – measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
4. **Prediction** – testing the model on new handwritten digits
